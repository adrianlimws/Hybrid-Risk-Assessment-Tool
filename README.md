# Hybrid-Risk-Assessment-Tool

This repository contains the **Hybrid Risk Assessment Tool**, an Excel-based, qualitative and quantitative project risk assessment framework. It combines elements from the Microsoft Risk Tool (2002) with the Griffith University Enterprise Risk Management Matrix to deliver a more detailed and flexible risk analysis process for modern projects.

### Overview

The Hybrid Risk Assessment Tool provides a structured approach to identifying, analysing, prioritising, and planning responses to project risks. By integrating best practices from Microsoft and Griffith University, it enables project managers to:

- Capture both qualitative (descriptive) and quantitative (numeric) risk characteristics.
- Track risk conditions, consequences, probability, and impact pre- and post-mitigation.
- Quantify exposure at each stage and derive visual risk levels and codes for prioritisation.

### Key Features

- **Dual-Source Methodology:** Incorporates frameworks from the Microsoft Risk Tool (2002) and Griffith University matrices, increasing analytical rigor and real-world relevance.[1]
- **Comprehensive Risk Evaluation:** Supports identification, detailed scoring (probability, impact, exposure), coding, and mapping of risks throughout a project’s lifecycle.
- **Pre- and Post-Mitigation Analysis:** Clearly documents changes in risk levels and exposures after mitigation and contingency plans are applied, enabling accurate measurement of control effectiveness.
- **Custom Templates:** Includes sheets for risk identification, analysis, prioritization, planning, costing, and lesson tracking, streamlining the risk management workflow.
- **Defined Scales and Lookup Tables:** Uses standardised probability and impact definitions and an automatic lookup to derive consistent risk level codes and priorities.

### Usage

1. **Risk Identification:** Brainstorm and document potential risks using guided templates.
2. **Assessment:** Enter qualitative descriptions and quantitative values (probabilities, impacts).
3. **Evaluation:** Review calculated exposures, risk codes, and risk levels pre- and post-mitigation.
4. **Planning:** Define targeted mitigation and contingency plans, responsibilities, triggers, and resourcing.
5. **Costing:** Estimate mitigation costs, apply pricing logic, and compare against competitive/project benchmarks.
6. **Monitoring:** Record actions, lessons learned, and update risk status as the project evolves.

### When To Use

This tool was originally created for a final semester capstone internship project at Ara Institute of Cantebury but it has the capability to cater for organisations and teams that need to go beyond basic “probability × impact” scoring, requiring more nuanced risk capture and transparent post-mitigation analysis. It is suitable for IT, engineering, research, and business improvement projects where risk management detail and auditability are critical.

Feel free to modify/edit/create your own approach from this template. I am a firm believer that tools can always be gradually improved and fit for purpose for anyone to leverage and utilise :)
